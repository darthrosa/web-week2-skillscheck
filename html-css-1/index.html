            <div id="image-box">According to Sidious, Plagueis was powerful enough that he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life and keep the ones he cared about from dying, a precious knowledge that awarded him the epithet of "The Wise".[2] However, Plagueis also developed a belief that the Force could "strike back" at him for his power.[3] In truth, he became so powerful that the only thing he still dreaded was losing his power. Ultimately, Plagueis' only fear was bound to come true. At some point Sidious had learned everything he needed from his master.[1] Moreover, he had acquired his own pupil in the Nightsister Mother Talzin's son, Darth Maul,[2] a young Dathomirian Zabrak whom Sidious had kidnapped from Talzin when he was only a child.</div>
